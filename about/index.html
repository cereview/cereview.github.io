  <p>Computers exists everywhere, from interstellar satellites to desktop computers, from a space shuttle’s control system to your own mobile phone; and from the high-speed data-crunching servers running at the CERN’s World-Wide LHC Computing Grid (WLCG) to your office’s coffee machine!</p>

<p>So, the question is, if something is so versatile, how could we comprehend it? Is there a common link to understand all the different types of computer systems? Fortunately, a link exists and it has been the driving force that has marked the works of computer scientists in the past 5 decades. Computer Engineering (abbr. as CE) encompasses a wide range of study disciplines, thinking methodologies and design ideas. Whether you are a scientific expert on CE or a lay-man looking for some of the most unique applications of CE in the scientific world you’ll definitely find something new here to read and learn about. The topics of articles might not be well-structured all through the way, but you can always catch up on the related topics by going through the Categories section.</p>

<p>We’ll trace the origins of computers; ponder over new computing paradigms like quantum computing, computation-in-memory, parallel-architectures, heterogeneous accelerators and much more. We’ll study their functioning on how the unique combination of Electronics and Computer Science bridges the hardware and software aspects of a computer system. I’ll also share some of my works in CE occasionally, that’ll surely help provide a real-world perspective of applications of CE.</p>

<p>CE-REVIEW a blog about a variety of topics in Computer Engineering, Hardware Design, Microelectronics, Experimental Physics and sometimes, just thoughts and philosophy.</p>

<p>If you like my work, I’ll be happy to receive your comments. And do share with others, as well. You are now all set to dive right in! <a href="http://cereview.github.io">Click here</a> to go back to the articles.
