<p><img src="/assets/images/01inv-colors-pdf.png" alt="inverted_color_pdf" /></p>

<p>In academia, we have to study a lot of portable document formats, or PDFs, as normal people say it. Digital transition to note taking can be benefitial to some to keep things organized in one place and be accessible whenever we need. This takes a toll on our eyes as prolonged exposure to screen is bad. Here is what I usually do.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Always set the theme to dark. This way the contrasts help reduce the stress on your eyes. In addition, I would keep the monitor/screen settings to slightly warm.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Google Chrome extensions help to invert the colors of all the websites that you visit. One of the extensions I like to use is called <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dark-reader-dark/kbbbldgkhcpkmmjbjelmkjkchibeklng">DarkReader</a> which automatically inverts colors for all the sites I visit. Selectively, I can uninvert colors back to normal when needed or toggle light/dark modes for specific websites.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>[In Adobe Acrobat]</strong> Now, coming back to the topic at hand. How to invert the colors of PDFs. If you like to use a PDF reader software like Adobe Acrobat, you can find this setting here: <strong>Menu</strong> &gt; <strong>Preferences</strong> &gt; <strong>Accessibility</strong> &gt; <strong>Replace Document Colors</strong><br />
I like to keep my settings to <em>White text on Black</em>.<br />
Additionally in Adobe Acrobat, my personal preference is to have two pages displayed at once. Perhaps because, in a sense, it gives a better approximation to handling an open book. This can be done from here: <strong>Menu</strong> &gt; <strong>View</strong> &gt; <strong>Page Display</strong> &gt; <strong>Two-page View</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>[In Google Chrome]</strong> If you often open PDFs in Google Chrome (using some pdf extension) directly and start reading there. Here is one thing you can do, Press Ctrl+Shift+I. Go to the <strong>Console</strong> tab, and paste the following code.</p>
    <div class="language-js highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">cover</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">document</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">createElement</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">div</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="kd">let</span> <span class="nx">css</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">`
position: fixed;
pointer-events: none;
top: 0;
left: 0;
width: 100vw;
height: 100vh;
background-color: white;
mix-blend-mode: difference;
z-index: 1;
`</span>
<span class="nx">cover</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">setAttribute</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">style</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">css</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="nb">document</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">body</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">appendChild</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">cover</span><span class="p">);</span>
</code></pre></div>    </div>
    <p>This temporarily inverts the colors of the PDF in the open PDF document. This unfortunately needs to be repeated everytime you open a PDF in a chrome tab.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h4 id="manage-you-papers-through-this-naming-scheme">Manage you papers through this naming scheme</h4>

<p>When you download papers either from arxiv or online digital libraries like ACM or IEEE (in my case). It is simply overwhelming to keep a track of where those papers are and how they can be searched for.</p>

<ul>
  <li>To keep it simple, I use the following naming convention for all the research paper PDFs:
    <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>yyyy_&lt;paper title&gt;_&lt;research group&gt;_&lt;univesity&gt;.pdf
</code></pre></div>    </div>
    <p>Having year in the beginning makes it easier to sort, and having title, research group and the university/organization name makes it easier to search.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The online google chrome extension called <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/arxiv-utils/mnhdpeipjhhkmlhlcljdjpgmilbmehij?hl=en">arxiv-utils</a> makes life much easier. It allows you to define this format in it’s settings, and adds a separate PDF download button called <strong>Direct Download</strong> on every <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">arxiv.org/abs</code> page which renames the PDF automatically in this format and downloads it for you. This is very useful.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Now how to best organize this in a directory structure? One of the directory structures I like to organize the files is the following:</li>
</ul>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>~\papers\
	|ISCA 2021
	|   |yyyymmdd_&lt;paper title&gt;_&lt;research group&gt;_&lt;univesity&gt;.pdf
	|   |...
	|ISSCC 2021
	|   |yyyymmdd_&lt;paper title&gt;_&lt;research group&gt;_&lt;univesity&gt;.pdf
	|   |...
	.   .
	.   .
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Another way to organize could be through topic categories. This I feel is not the best organization. Having the papers sorted according to conferences, already gives you enough information to know the types/topic category of papers you can find in that conference.</p>

<p>If you found this post useful, share it with your peers. You may also leave a comment and let me know.

ACM 64, 12, December 2021, pp. 58-65, https://doi.org/10.1145/3467017</p>

<h4 id="synopsis">Synopsis</h4>
<p>The term, Hardware Lottery, is used to define the unintentional prejudice observed historically towards certain research ideas in computer science that succeed, not because they were far superior to others but due to how well-suited they were for the available hardware and software of the time, often creating ‘noise’ to the interpretability of new research directions. The domain-specific era is even more prone to this, where the hardware landscape is getting even more fragmented. Figure 1 demonstrates this. Writing software for each system is expensive and even then chances are only those companies would succeed whose technologies can successfully be adopted to commercial applications. Specialised hardware can be replaced with the advent of newer technologies, therefore scalability and adoptability is critical to a hardware development infrastructure.</p>

Figure 1: Peak performance vs peak power of publically announced accelerators in 2022 <a href="https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2210.04055">[arxiv:2210.04055]</a></p>

<h4 id="strengths">Strengths</h4>
<p>The numerous examples from history from Edison’s Phonograph to modern GPUs is an eye opener and provides a broader perspective to think about the larger picture of computing hardware landscape. The presented solutions are agreed upon propositions in the research community. The emphasis on revisiting FPGAs and CGRAs for harmonising hardware development, developing better profiling tools and using AI for design space exploration is something I agree with. Secondly, just like hardware is being evolved to be highly parameterized, parameterized DSLs for reproducing results on different hardware is necessary (functional programming, and a higher abstraction level of application specification can help: e.g. Code Generating (Explainable) AI for hardware backends).</p>

<h4 id="weaknesses">Weaknesses</h4>
<p>The article highlights the issues that cost, limited availability, and the lack of standardisation in hardware, will make it difficult for researchers to replicate or reproduce results. One potential missing element in the article is the discussion that the difficulties in obtaining hardware resources also limits the number of researchers working on certain problems, and slowing down of progress in certain areas. It leads to a lack of diversity in the types of research being conducted, as researchers may be limited to working on problems that can be solved with the hardware they have available (not to mention, Gartner Hype Cycle). Additionally, an obstacle is technology not being available for researchers from underprivileged countries, institutions or backgrounds (IC production is Expensive!). Lastly, it could also be discussed that standardising a set of norms for developers (in academia and industry) would help mitigate the fragmented landscape, e.g. with the open-source hardware platform like RISC-V, and compiler infrastructure like LLVM/MLIR.</p>

<h4 id="thoughts">Thoughts</h4>
<p>Domain-Specific era didn’t dawn until Moore’s Law and Dennard Scaling stopped to apply. It can be worth investigating the next research idea (after-domain specific) and lay a path for its integration in future, which might not apply today for immediate adoption but can be simply available when needed [<span style="color:#00689A;">1</span>, <span style="color:#00689A;">2</span>]. This can be an expensive endeavour and may not succeed - “being too early is the same as being wrong” - so caution must be exercised. For academic research, some areas include, photonic accelerator, synaptic transistor, memristor array, new memory technology, neuromorphic etc. for hardware; Neurosymbolic AI, Formal Methods etc. for software. Secondly, while it is true presently that having specialised hardware can greatly accelerate the training of deep learning models, there are also other ways to address the issue of creating uniformity in the domain-specific landscape, such as algorithmic research to use general purpose hardware (not everything needs DL), using cloud computing resources, and creating cross-DSL(domain-specific language) compilers, DSE tools and open-source solutions. Lastly, one positive impact in the DS-era would be that small teams and independent researchers would be making breakthroughs with more limited resources through the use of creative solutions and open-source tools.</p>

<h4 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h4>
<p>Hardware development maintained its course ever since the 90s, however software developed fast (number of ML publications since 2005). This led to hardware being abstracted away completely by software. With increasing software complexity, hardware will be a key factor that would dictate the success for a research idea [<span style="color:#00689A;">3</span>]. Whereas for the hardware competing in the ‘bigger is better’ race, history tells us, “a deficiency in any one number of factors dooms an endeavour to failure.” A critical understanding of the hardware/software landscape, their compatibility and co-designability is therefore elemental.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Large new neural networks would need faster development time for corresponding accelerators, some architectures would need even more constrained design than scaling systolic arrays/vector architectures e.g. [<span style="color:#00689A;">4</span>, <span style="color:#00689A;">5</span>, <span style="color:#00689A;">6</span>] and [<span style="color:#00689A;">7</span>].</li>
  <li>Accelerating development time and cost is essential for hardware engineers. Ideas like [<span style="color:#00689A;">8</span>, <span style="color:#00689A;">9</span>] didn’t succeed because the cost of iteration was too high. For software, developers need to come up with creative solutions to adapt to the current norm of accelerators.</li>
  <li>Looking ahead is essential to progress, ideas respawn when the time is right e.g. the case of deep neural networks in software and [<span style="color:#00689A;">10</span>, <span style="color:#00689A;">11</span>] for corresponding hardware. Additionally, DNNs may not be the only way forward, at some point a new technology may spawn (e.g. something that better resembles the human brain) and we may have to redo everything. Scaling and Adaptability here needs more emphasis.</li>
  <li>From an economist’s perspective, the law of supply and demand is at play here. In one line, “Necessity is the mother of invention”.</li>
</ul>

<p>“Our own cognitive intelligence is both hardware and software [a domain-specific computer].”</p>

<p>“[accelerators] Happy families are all alike, unhappy families are unhappy in their own way.”</p>

<p>“[bigger is better race] An apt metaphor is that we may be trying to build a ladder to the moon.”</p>

<p>“Scientific progress occurs when there is a confluence of factors which allows scientists to overcome the ‘stickiness’ of the existing paradigm.”</p>

<p>“Registering what differs from our expectations, remains a key catalyst in driving new scientific discoveries.”</p>

<h4 id="case-study-of-isa">Case study of ISA</h4>
<p>Krste Asanovic once said, ‘Don’t make your own ISAs.’ This is partly true in the sense that an incompatible ISA without existing software would never make it to upstream. We have observed the success of two proprietary ISAs so far, x86_64 and ARM32/64, asserting their dominance in desktop/server and mobile markets, respectively due to them being early and developing their own software ecosystem. Other ISAs of the time VAX, MIPS, SPARC etc became only moderately successful (and are now out of circulation). Why is it partly true? Because new systems, like Graphcore and Cerebras are bringing enough performance (in addition to marketing) to the table to compete in the HPC space.</p>
